## Cast Checker


Developers relax restrictions on a type to reuse methods with other types. While type casts are prevalent, in weakly typed languages such as C++, they are also extremely permissive. If type conversions are performed without care, they can lead to software bugs. Therefore, there is a clear need to check whether a type conversion is essential and used adequately according to the developerâ€™s intent. In this paper, we propose a technique to judge the fidelity of type conversions from an explicit cast operation, using the identifiers in an assignment. We measure accord in the identifiers using conditional entropy and use it to check if the semantics of the source expression in the cast match the semantics of the variable it is being assigned. We present the results of running our tool on 34 components of the Chromium project, which collectively account for 27MLOC. Our tool flags 8,459 cases of discord indicating potential anti-patterns in the usage of explicit casts or imprecise names for the identifiers used in the named cast. We performed a user study on a random-uniform sample from the corpus. Our evaluation shows that our tool has a precision of 81%, a recall of 90% and an accuracy of 92% in identifying correctly flagged cases. We present the findings of an in-depth investigation for notable explicit cast cases from the Chromium project.
